Thank you for your attention to our manuscript on graduate pay and placement success in US political science departments.

The data repository for this project contains five files:

• stipends.xlsx provides data collected from PhDStipends.com in January 2022

• programs.xlsx provides data collected about each PhD program in political science

• 1_prep.R provides the code used to combine the above spreadsheets into an analysis dataset

• 2_analysis.R provides the code used to create the figures and tables in the main text

• results.RData provides the output (as objects in an R environment) of models presented in the
main text

Finally, codebooks for each of the two spreadsheets are in the Memo.pdf file.
